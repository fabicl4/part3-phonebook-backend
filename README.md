# part3-phonebook-backend

This repository is the implementation of execises 3.9 and 3.10.

I use Render to create the Web Application

At the time you check, the application may or may not be deployed!

You can access the application in the following link:
https://part3-phonebook-backend-sd8y.onrender.com

Currently there is a bug (not present in the part2 phonebook solution) when you delete an entry from the phonebook, you need to restart the browser tab.

You can also execute the project using: npm run dev
